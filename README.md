*disclaimer* i have no idea what im doing.

however welcome to vault forge project that im making to use obsidian for my main d&d platform

VaultForge-Core : main plugin, indexes vault with openai and houses askvault, buildindex, and askvaultconcise.

VaultForge-Chat : branch to call on askvault to chat with open ai directly with in note function. uses vault context for responses.

VaultForge-Talk : NPC based chat where you can talk to the npc, working on openai, and openai tts with ssml. 

VaultForge-5eTools : 5etools repo used in a way that is databased with sql and can be called on an put into notes (need to add yaml formatting later)

VaultForge-Player : Player side character sheet, invintory, spells, shops, maps, and handouts. using server through obsidian and qr code for access. updates to obsisian file yaml.

VaultForge-generate : [placeholder] tool to find and recommend context holes in game to fill and autogen missing context/links/tags on already existing lore. generate from template using vault context.

VaultForge-Map : [placeholder] tool to generate maps using context, auto label, and update based on context. 

vault's structure in mind 
[vault]>[(npcs),(locations),(story),(players),(quest),(ect)] this is what i used when built.

5etools database /data was used to construct the 5etools.db with meta tags (yaml update coming)

Trying to learn coding by doing with help in VScodium and ChatGPT, and ChatGPT-API. 
thanks for checking it out.
